###Setup Guide - Product Import Export for WooCommerce###

For learning more about the set up of the Product Import Export plugin for WooCommerce, refer to its <a href="https://www.webtoffee.com/product-import-export-plugin-woocommerce-user-guide/">setup guide</a>.

You can also check out this video to get a quick understanding of the plugin.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYvt_KSYfNY]

### How Does the Plugin Work? (Import of WooCommerce Products using CSV) ###

The WooCommerce Product Import Export Plugin takes CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file as input. You must create a CSV ( UTF-8 Encoded ) file and enter the product details in a structured format. 

This is to match each field of CSV file to the field of a particular product which otherwise Admin need to input manually. For example, the post_title field gets mapped to the product name and the regular_price field gets mapped to the regular price of the product. 

You can create the CSV from scratch or you can export products to get the format of CSV. You can use a spreadsheet program, such as LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice, or Google Spreadsheets for creating and modifying the CSV file. Save this file with extension ".CSV". 

After entering all details about products in a spreadsheet, you can import products to your WooCommerce store. With this plugin, you can also export and download product details as a CSV.

### WooCommerce import products (all product types are supported) ###

###WooCommerce export and import products with images (supports simple & variation images) ###

The plugin facilitates the easy import of images related to a product. When the products are imported using the plugin, the first image related to a product in the image column of the CSV file is taken as its featured image. If there are multiple images in the same column, the image(s) after the first one is taken as the gallery images of the product.
